# We Are Outdated

A demo released by vurpo at Deadline 2024. It got second place!

The original nfo file, bundled with the party release:

```
We Are Outdated
- a Wii U demo by vurpo

How to run:
- Have a hacked Wii U with Aroma
- Place wuhb file in /wiiu/apps/ on SD
- Find the demo on your Wii U homescreen

Does not run correctly in Cemu. Sorry.

Extra greetings to the Wii U community,
especially to Exzap, Crementif and others
for creating CafeGLSL and also providing
useful help during development!

Fuckings to Nintendo, you know what you did.
```

The code is based upon https://github.com/glastonbridge/immaterial-wiiu-demo . I modified it by ruining the separation of concerns, to put more kool effects in there!
